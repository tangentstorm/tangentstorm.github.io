<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
J is so different from other programming languages that I might as well be a complete beginner, even though I've been programming for over 20 years.
</p>

<p>
While my experience writing code doesn't help much with J, I've also accumulated experience about <i>how to learn</i> new languages, and <i>how to solve programming problems</i> in general.
</p>

<p>
This is the story of how I tackled a small problem in an unfamilar language.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> this article is about a <i>learning process</i>, not about the actual code. J is cryptic, and my "beginner J" code is probably terrible. I will explain the basic ideas as I go along, but try to focus on the general approach to problem solving and don't worry too much about understanding the code.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Problem Statement and Intermediate Solutions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
My goal was to implement a J verb (basically a function) to make all the lower-case letters in an ASCII string uppercase, while leaving other characters unchanged.
</p>

<p>
It took me an hour to produce this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j"><span style="color: #eedd82;">string</span> =. <span style="color: #00ff00;">'"Please, Sir, could you make this upper case?" said Pip.'</span>
(<span style="color: #eedd82;">chr</span>=.{&amp;<span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>) s -32&amp;* e.&amp;((ord <span style="color: #00ff00;">'a'</span>)+(i.26))  <span style="color: #eedd82;">s</span>=.(<span style="color: #eedd82;">ord</span>=.a.&amp;i.) string
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you type that into the J terminal, you get:
</p>

<pre class="example">
"PLEASE, SIR, COULD YOU MAKE THIS UPPER CASE?" SAID PIP.
</pre>

<p>
The above code is just an expression, not a verb, but once I got that far, I used one of J's built-in routines to "simplify" it for me:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j"><span style="color: #eedd82;">upcase</span> =. [: ([: {&amp;<span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span> ] - [: 32&amp;* e.&amp;(97+i.26)) <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>&amp;i.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I <i>told</i> you J was cryptic.
</p>

<p>
I can't fully explain this line myself yet, but I <i>can</i> tell you how I came up with it, starting almost from scratch.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Blank Slate : A Quick Taste of J</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Code in general is often unreadable to the untrained eye, and part of learning a language is adjusting to the visual shape of the code.
</p>

<p>
For me, even python was difficult to read until I got used to looking at it, and I was coming from <i>perl</i>, another notoriously cryptic language.
</p>

<p>
From a <i>learning to learn</i> perspective, J has the advantage of a large vocabulary comprised almost entirely of ASCII punctuation characters, many of which have at least six different meanings &#x2013; so I have a tendency to forget what I've learned and have to re-learn it. :)
</p>

<p>
For example, the character <code>\plus</code> can be used to form any of the following three verbs: { <code>\plus</code>  <code>\plus.</code>  <code>\plus:</code> }, each of which has separate meanings depending on whether it's used in a prefix ("monadic") or infix ("dyadic") context.
</p>

<p>
Dyadic <code>1 \plus 1</code> means <i>one plus one</i>, and monadic <code>+ 1</code> means something like <i>positive one</i> <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. In J, <i>every</i> verb has two meanings like this.
</p>

<p>
Further, J generalizes each verb to work with multi-dimensional arrays. For example, dyadic <code>x \plus. y</code> is the <i>greatest common denominator</i> verb.
</p>

<p>
The following transcript of an interactive J session shows how these concepts are combined.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: J is available for free from <a href="http://jsoftware.com/">http://jsoftware.com/</a> if you want to follow along.

That's enough to get the basic idea of J code: very little syntax, just a lot of verbs to make things happen.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> On to <code>upcase</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I learned the basic concept of converting an ASCII string to upper case a <i>long</i> time ago. Here's how I first implemented it in turbo pascal, probably around 1992 (again, you don't really need to understand the code):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-pascal"><span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold;">upstr</span>( s : <span style="color: #ff00ff;">string</span> ) : <span style="color: #ff00ff;">string</span>;
    <span style="color: #ff00ff;">var</span> count : byte;
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">begin</span>
    <span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span> count := 1 <span style="color: #00ffff;">to</span> length( s ) <span style="color: #00ffff;">do</span>
      s[ count ] := upcase( s[ count ] );
    upstr := s;
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">end</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Basically, in turbo pascal, <code>upcase(ch:char):char</code> was built-in, so I just had to loop through a string and apply <code>upcase</code> to each character.<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
If I'd had to write <code>upcase</code> myself, though, it probably would have looked like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-pascal"><span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold;">upcase</span>( ch : <span style="color: #ff00ff;">char</span> ) : <span style="color: #ff00ff;">char</span>;
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">begin</span>
    <span style="color: #00ffff;">if</span> ch <span style="color: #00ffff;">in</span> [<span style="color: #00ff00;">'a'</span>..<span style="color: #00ff00;">'z'</span>] <span style="color: #00ffff;">then</span> 
      upcase := ord(ch) + (ord(<span style="color: #00ff00;">'A'</span>) - chr(<span style="color: #00ff00;">'a'</span>)) 
    <span style="color: #00ffff;">else</span>
      upcase := ch;   <span style="color: #66f;">{ </span><span style="color: #66f;">Or in moden-day pascal, 'result := ...' </span><span style="color: #66f;">}</span>
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">end</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The functions <code>Ord</code> and <code>Chr</code> are primitives.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> <code>Ord(ch)</code> converts a character into a number and <code>Chr(x)</code> converts a number to the equivalent character.
</p>

<p>
Eight bit characters are indistinguishable from any other bytes in memory<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>, and in languages like C, there is no distinction between a <code>byte</code> and a <code>character</code>.  Pascal made the distinction at compile time, for type safety, but there is no actual machine code required to perform the operations.
</p>

<p>
J, on the other hand, is a dynamically typed language, where numbers and strings have different internal representations (probably differing at least by an extra byte encoding the type) and have to be explicitly converted.
</p>

<p>
My hunch was that if I could figure out how to implement <code>Ord</code> and <code>Chr</code> in J, the rest of the problem would be easy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> <code>a.</code> is for Alphabet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I knew J supported strings, but I didn't know exacly how they worked.
</p>

<p>
The first rule of learning a programming language is to get familiar with its documentation.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to memorize every word, or even read it all at once. Just know what resources are available, and remember where to find them.
</p>

<p>
With J, I often start with the <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/vocabul.htm">vocabulary page</a>, because it lists all the symbols and their names. <sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There's nothing on the vocabulary page about strings, but there is an entry for <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dadot.htm ">a. <i>Alphabet</i> &frasl; <i>Ace</i> </a>, and following the link confirmed that it was a predefined array representing the character set.
</p>

<p>
I typed it in the J terminal, and saw a bunch of garbage:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>    <span style="color: #66f;">NB. output manually edited to reove many non-ascii characters</span>
\001\002\003\004\005\006\007\010        
\013\014  ... \037!"#$%&amp;<span style="color: #00ff00;">'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO</span>
<span style="color: #00ff00;">PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~....</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Given this array, <code>chr(n)</code> would just mean retrieving the the <i>nth</i> item, and <code>ord(ch)</code> would involve searching through the array to find the index of the given character.
</p>

<p>
In the languages I'm used to, this would probably might mean typing <code>a[65]</code> and <code>a.index('a')</code>, but J has a completely different syntax that I can never remember.
</p>

<p>
Often, when you're learning something, the documentation will explain something, but you won't have enough experience to really understand what you're reading.
</p>

<p>
With J in particular, I have a bad tendency to gloss over examples in the docs because I often don't even understand the mathematical concepts they're trying to illustrate.
</p>

<p>
In this case, the page for <code>a.</code> showed an example for displaying the printable ascii characters:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   1 2 3 { 8 32 $ <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>                    <span style="color: #66f;">NB. From the J docs for a.</span>
 !"#$%&amp;<span style="color: #00ff00;">'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?</span>
<span style="color: #00ff00;">@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_</span>
<span style="color: #00ff00;">`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~&#127;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I actually understand enough J that I should have known what this was doing:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dyadic <code>x $ y</code> (<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/d210.htm">Shape</a>) reshapes array <code>y</code> to the dimensions specified by <code>x</code>.
</li>
<li>Dyadic <code>x { y</code> (<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/d520.htm">From</a>) extracts the elements specified in <code>x</code> from array <code>y</code>. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So in this case, the  <code>8 32 $ a.</code> arranges the characters of <code>a.</code> into an 8 &times; 32 grid, and then the <code>1 2 3 { ...</code> part extracts the second, third, and fourth rows (array indices start at 0).
</p>

<p>
Had I paid more attention, I would have seen immediately that the way to write <code>chr(n)</code> (or at least <code>a[n])</code> in J is <code>n{a.</code> .
</p>

<p>
I did look at the example, but the way I mentally chunked it, I just saw "here's a way to arrange the ascii characters" without considering how it worked (or even really noticing which characters were involved).
</p>

<p>
In any case, I was thinking more about <code>Ord</code> than <code>Chr</code> anyway, and I had a few guesses about how I might implement it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Hunting down <code>Ord</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Back on the <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/vocabul.htm">J Vocabulary</a> page, I did a quick search for the word "index" and saw <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/didot.htm">i. <i>Integers</i> &frasl; <i>Index Of</i> </a>.
</p>

<p>
I happened to know that <code>A</code> is ASCII character #65 (confirmed by typing <code>ord('A')</code> into a python prompt) so here's what I expected to happen:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #00ff00;">'a'</span> i. <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>      <span style="color: #66f;">NB. What I expected:</span>
65
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But instead:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #00ff00;">'a'</span> i. <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>      <span style="color: #66f;">NB. What really happened:</span>
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This bears very little correspondence to any notion I have of an index.
</p>

<p>
The docs explain <i>what</i> it's doing (sort of), but not <i>why</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="figure">
<p>
</p>
</div>

<p>
If <code>rix</code> is the rank of an item of <code>x</code>, then the shape of the result of <code>x i. y</code> is <code>(-rix)}.$y</code> . Each atom of the result is either <code>#x</code> or the index of the first occurrence among the items of x of the corresponding <code>rix</code>-cell of <code>y</code>. 
</p>

<p>
The comparison in <code>x i. y</code> is tolerant, and fit can be used to specify the tolerance, as in <code>i. !. t</code> . 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I don't know yet what tolerance means or how to interpret <code>(-rix)}.$y</code> &#x2013; clearly these docs are written for people who are already familiar with array languages, and perhaps when I have more experience dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, this seemingly strange behavior will make perfect sense.
</p>

<p>
And yet, this operation is called <i>Index Of</i>, and the practical result in this particular case is that it produces an array with a bunch of ones and one zero. I didn't count at the time, but the 0 is in the 98th slot, because <code>Ord('a')</code> = 97 (lower case).
</p>

<p>
At this point, I rejected <code>i.</code> as a path to <code>Ord</code>, but I remembered there's a verb called <i>Copy</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Take a left on Nub Street (or how to find <i>Copy</i> when what you want is <i>Select</i>)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Usually, when I play around with J, I find myself searching for that <code>a[n]</code> syntax. We just saw that it's  <code>n{a</code>, but I usually forget this, and have to search for it again.
</p>

<p>
What usually happens is that look through the vocabulary page for a word like "select" or "index", and, after trying:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   0 i. <span style="color: #00ff00;">'abc'</span>     <span style="color: #66f;">NB. hoping for 'a', but that's not what 'Index Of' means</span>
<span style="color: #00ff00;">1 1 1</span>

<p>
I usually wind up looking at the definition of <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/d222.htm">~: <i>Nub Sieve</i> &frasl; <i>Not Equal</i> </a>, because the word "sieve" is the closest thing that matches my idea of selecting items from an array. That page says:
</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="figure">
<p>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<code>~:y</code> is the boolean list b such that <code>b#y</code> is the nub of <code>y</code>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Apparently, <i>nub</i> is their word for the unique value in an array:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   ~: <span style="color: #00ff00;">'Mississippi'</span>             <span style="color: #66f;">NB. the example from the "nub sieve" docs</span>
1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

   (~: <span style="color: #00ff00;">'Mississippi'</span>) # <span style="color: #00ff00;">'Mississippi'</span>   <span style="color: #66f;">NB. not in docs, but should be. :)</span>
Misp
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So a "nub sieve" isn't what I want, but it looks like this <code>#</code> thing is a bit like the generic "select" I'm looking for.
</p>

<p>
This is line of searching is something I went through several times when I experimented casually with J in the past. How did I keep missing <code>#</code> when looking for my hypothetical <i>Select</i> operator?
</p>

<p>
I kept missing it because <code>#</code> is named <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/d400.htm"># <i>Tally</i> &frasl; <i>Copy</i> </a>.
</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="figure">
<p>
</p>
</div>

<p>
If the arguments have an equal number of items, then <code>x#y</code> copies <code>+/x</code> items from <code>y</code>, with <code>i{x</code> repetitions of item <code>i{y</code> . Otherwise, if one is an atom it is repeated to make the item count of the arguments equal. 
</p>

<p>
The complex left argument <code>a j. b</code> copies <code>a</code> items followed by <code>b</code> fills. The fit conjunction provides specified fills, as in <code>#!.f</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Not knowing what <code>i{x</code> meant (again, <code>x[i]</code>, the thing I was usually searching for when I wound up here), the text above didn't usually make sense to me.
</p>

<p>
As I sit here writing now, most of the documentation I read makes sense, but when I'm in "problem solving" mode, there just isn't time or room in my head to carefully analyze each page.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I'm doing a broad search, attempting to find the pages that are most likely to answer my question, and glossing over anything that doesn't immediately match.
</p>

<p>
This may seem like an inefficient and error-prone process compared to just working through a tutorial, but it works.
</p>

<p>
Reading a tutorial is a bit like taking a guided tour of a city. You get to see some interesting things and travel in comfort, but everything you encounter has been prepared for you in advance.
</p>

<p>
My approach is more like going to a new city and picking an arbitrary goal: <i>find the library</i> or <i>find a nice park</i>&#x2026;. and then just heading out to explore. I'll probably get lost a few times, and completely miss out on a few popular attractions at first, but eventually I get to know my way around the place, in a way a tourist probably never will.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, in my wanderings through the "City of J", I kept setting out to <i>find the Select verb</i> and instead found myself over on <i>Nub Sieve avenue</i>, which of course eventually would bring me back to <i>Copy</i>.
</p>

<p>
So why on earth is <i>Select</i> called <i>Copy</i>?
</p>

<p>
Well of course, it <i>isn't</i>. What I thought of s <i>Select</i> is just <i>From</i> in J, and it's just the <code>{</code> symbol that keeps showing up: 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   0 2 4 { <span style="color: #00ff00;">'abcdefg'</span>
ace
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But <i>Copy</i> can do the same thing in a pinch, if you also happen to find
dyadic <code>e.</code> (called <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dedot.htm"> <i>Member (In)</i> </a> in the J docs, but I would have called it <i>Element Of</i>).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #66f;">NB. Selecting values directly with 'Copy':</span>
   1 0 1 0 1 0 0 # <span style="color: #00ff00;">'abcdefg'</span>
ace

   <span style="color: #66f;">NB. For each integer 0..6, is it an element of the array 0 2 4 ?</span>
   (i.7) e. 0 2 4
1 0 1 0 1 0 0

   <span style="color: #66f;">NB. Combining those two ideas:</span>
   ((i.7) e. 0 2 4) # <span style="color: #00ff00;">'abcdefg'</span>
ace
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Obviously this so-called <i>Copy</i> thing this is pretty terrible compared to <code>{</code> , because <code>{</code> doesn't require you to know the length or to fill in all those zeros, but at least we know "the long way" to get to <i>Select</i>.
</p>

<p>
But why on earth is it called <i>Copy</i>?!?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   0 1 2 3 # <span style="color: #00ff00;">'abcd'</span> 
bccddd
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Oh.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> From <i>Copy</i> to <i>Chr</i></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
So there I was, looking at:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #00ff00;">'a'</span> i. <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I remember my earlier discovery of <i>Copy</i> and think to myself that if I could swap the zeros and ones, then perhaps it would bring me closer to <code>Ord</code> or <code>Chr</code>.
</p>

<p>
I look up how to do <i>Not</i> in the vocabulary. It's spelled <code>-.</code> in J, and it's really <code>1 - x</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
So now I can do:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #66f;">NB. Just using (8 32 $) here to reformat the results:</span>

</pre>
</div>


<p>
I didn't really know where I was going with this, yet, but I figured I could use <i>Copy</i> and the above pattern to get the letter 'a' back out of the alphabet. The first thing I tried happened to work:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #66f;">NB. ~ swaps the arguments of a verb so that  a. #~ x   becomes  x # a.</span>
   <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span> #~  -. <span style="color: #00ff00;">'a'</span> i. <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>
a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So at this point, I'd essentially implemented an identity function that was somewhere in the ballpark of <code>chr(ord(ch))</code>, but I needed to figure out how to extract the individual components.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Rummaging</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
My next few attempts didn't work at all. I figured if I could put an 'a' in and get an 'a' out, maybe I could do the same thing for an entire string.
</p>

<p>
First I tried just replacing the string, and I <i>got an error</i>. I tried the exact same thing again and <i>got an error</i>.
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span>#~-.<span style="color: #00ff00;">'apples'</span>i.a.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next I <i>tried some other stuff</i> and <i>some stuff happened</i>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   <span style="color: #00ff00;">'apples'</span>i.a       <span style="color: #66f;">NB. I forgot the . in a. but failed to notice</span>

<span style="color: #00ff00;">'apples'</span> i.~/ a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's hard to express my thought process at this point.
</p>

<p>
The side comments I wrote above are things I'm observing as I write this document, but in the moment, I probably wasn't aware of any of it.
</p>

<p>
In the moment, I had no idea why things weren't working, and was just trying lots of different things.
</p>

<p>
This is basically <i>rummaging</i> here. I didn't have a clear idea what I was looking for, but I had a sense that <i>something was wrong</i>, and was mostly typing on autopilot. I probably issued all of the above commands within the span of 30 seconds or so.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, my brain caught up to my fingers, I noticed the missing period in <code>a.</code>, and  typed what I really wanted to type:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">  <span style="color: #00ff00;">'apples'</span> i.a.      
6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 1 6
6 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This result is also completely unexpected to me. 
</p>

<p>
Once again, here is the description of dyadic <code>i.</code> (<i>Index Of</i>):
</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="figure">
<p>
</p>
</div>

<p>
If <code>rix</code> is the rank of an item of <code>x</code>, then the shape of the result of <code>x i. y</code> is <code>(-rix)}.$y</code> . Each atom of the result is either <code>#x</code> or the index of the first occurrence among the items of x of the corresponding <code>rix</code>-cell of <code>y</code>. 
</p>

<p>
The comparison in <code>x i. y</code> is tolerant, and fit can be used to specify the tolerance, as in <code>i. !. t</code> . 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I still don't understand why any of this would be useful, but I know <code>#x</code> means length (<i>Tally</i>) and 6 is the length of the string 'apples'.
</p>

<p>
Siting here writing this, I can see that the indices of the string 'apples' are <code>0 1 2 3 4 5</code> and so <code>6</code> is a perfectly logical "not found".
</p>

<p>
If you look closely, you can see that the numbers <code>0 1 3 4 5</code> all appear in that field of sixes, but <code>2</code> does not. That makes sense because:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   1 2 { <span style="color: #00ff00;">'apples'</span>
pp
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What's happening with the sixes is that given each ascii character, J is searching for its first position in the string 'apples'.
</p>

<p>
In other words, I had the parameters backwards, and what I should have typed was this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j">   a.i.<span style="color: #00ff00;">'apples'</span>
97 112 112 108 101 115
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And in fact, that is exactly the definition I eventually came up with for <code>Ord</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-j"><span style="color: #eedd82;">ord</span> =. <span style="color: #7fffd4;">a.</span> &amp; i.    <span style="color: #66f;">NB. The '&amp;' is an operator that transforms dyadic i. into</span>
                  <span style="color: #66f;">NB. a new verb (which I assigned to the variable 'ord')</span>
                  <span style="color: #66f;">NB. Now: (ord x) = ((a.&amp;i.) x) = (a. i. x)  </span>
                  <span style="color: #66f;">NB. This transformation is called "partial application".</span>

   ord <span style="color: #00ff00;">'apples'</span>
97 112 112 108 101 115
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, <i>in the moment</i>, the giant pile of sixes made no sense to me, and I wasn't able to follow this train of thought.
</p>

<p>
Instead, my failed attempt to use double quotes for a string reminded me of the concept of <i>rank</i>, and so I took a wrong turn.
