13:03:26 sirdancealo3 i thing your structure is targeted at a lower level
13:03:40 @tangentstorm What do you mean?
13:04:06 sirdancealo3 whats a mirror node?
13:04:42 @tangentstorm you get that there are a bunch of rings, and the rings form a tree, right?
13:04:47 sirdancealo3 yeah
13:04:59 @tangentstorm so not all the nodes in the rings have children
13:05:15 @tangentstorm if a node has a child, then that child is a ring.
13:05:25 @tangentstorm but not all nodes have children.
13:05:39 @tangentstorm so in a normal tree, the nodes without children are the leaves.
13:05:50 @tangentstorm each of those leaves is on one of the rings.
13:05:52 @tangentstorm with me so far?
13:08:12 @tangentstorm &#x2026;
13:08:27 sirdancealo3 yeah
13:08:27 sirdancealo3 a node is also a one man ring
13:08:27 sirdancealo3 and a leaf is a node without children
13:08:32 sirdancealo3 anyway..im not a math person..what is the purpose of the data structure?
13:08:37 sirdancealo3 the use
13:08:52 @tangentstorm sorry i seem to be lagging by like almost 2 mins according to weechat :(
13:09:19 @tangentstorm see&#x2026; the tree contains a program
13:09:25 @tangentstorm each ring is a loop.
13:09:33 @tangentstorm each node contains an instruction.
13:10:01 @tangentstorm multiple rings represent multiple concurrent tasks.
13:10:30 @tangentstorm but if you only have one turist (instruction pointer&#x2026;)
13:10:33 sirdancealo3 The jumptree is well suited for situations where you need to need to traverse a tree
in arbitrary directions.
13:10:42 @tangentstorm then you need to switch between those concurrent tasks.
13:11:49 @tangentstorm Since every downward link points to a node on a ring, the downward links can rotate
to point to different items.
13:11:53 sirdancealo3 so you have item nodes, ring "parents", and special clasp type that marks the end of
the ring and carries the parent pointer
13:12:36 sirdancealo3 sorry for interrupting
13:12:47 @tangentstorm item = instruction&#x2026; parent = subroutine call&#x2026; clasp = return from routine / go
back to top of loop
13:13:45 sirdancealo3 in ordinary computer science theory, you have to choose, a subroutine or a
thread..not both
13:13:51 @tangentstorm the rim is simply a linked list of all the leaf nodes in a single ring.
13:14:47 @tangentstorm subroutines and threads are different things.
13:15:08 sirdancealo3 but it could be sort of a synchronization&#x2026;structure&#x2026;thing..
13:15:33 @tangentstorm a thread is basically a virtual instruction pointer / cpu&#x2026; it's a thing that
moves around the tree of your source code.
13:15:50 @tangentstorm a subroutine is the thing through which it moves.
13:16:39 sirdancealo3 im asking if the tree levels represent subroutines or parallel threads
13:17:06 @tangentstorm think of it as an org chart in the company.
</p>


<p>
13:17:09 @tangentstorm a company.
13:17:20 @tangentstorm each ring is a department or job
13:17:54 @tangentstorm so it's likea  a routine that needs to be populated with workers
13:18:00 @tangentstorm worker = thread.
13:18:43 @tangentstorm if the company is fully staffed then each job is filled by a dedicated worker.
13:19:02 @tangentstorm if the company is not fully staffed then some workers must fill multiple jobs.
13:19:08 @tangentstorm (multi-tasking)
13:19:51 sirdancealo3 ok
13:19:53 @tangentstorm but suppose there is a job that many different people can do.
13:20:12 @tangentstorm i could do step 1, and then get called away.
13:20:24 @tangentstorm now i remeber that i'm about to do step 2, but you don't know that.
13:20:40 @tangentstorm so even though you  can do the job you won't because it's already in progress and
you don't know where i left it.
13:20:58 sirdancealo3 :)
13:21:20 @tangentstorm but suppose instead of keeping it in my head, the steps were arranged in a ring,
and there was a pointer showing which one was next.
13:21:38 @tangentstorm then i can just leave, and whoever shows up next can just start on step 2.
13:22:15 @tangentstorm the child pointer serves this purpose.
13:22:43 @tangentstorm or
13:22:54 @tangentstorm the child pointer could just point at the clasp, which is the "start"
13:23:04 @tangentstorm (also the end of course)
13:23:19 @tangentstorm the clasp is allowed to have an arbitrary child
13:23:33 @tangentstorm so as you walk the tree, you arrive at this clasp.
13:23:51 @tangentstorm if the child of the clasp is not itself, then you start a new instance of the
thread.
13:24:08 sirdancealo3 mm
13:24:19 @tangentstorm if the child of the clasp is one of its siblings, then there is work in progress
and you can pick up on that job where the last guy left off.
13:24:41 @tangentstorm (you close the door behind you by setting the clasp's child back to the clasp itself)
13:24:44 @tangentstorm here's the thing
13:24:48 sirdancealo3 why do you imagine people leaving their job like that?
13:25:00 @tangentstorm it's just a metaphor.
13:25:07 @tangentstorm but one reason is that the company is understaffed
13:25:15 @tangentstorm and so they have to go do their other job.
13:25:36 @tangentstorm here's the thing:
13:25:52 @tangentstorm it doesn't matter whether you pick the next task to be done or start a new task.
13:26:04 @tangentstorm your choice can be completely random.
13:26:26 @tangentstorm because if you resume the previous task, the door closes behind you and the clasp
now links back to itself.
13:27:01 @tangentstorm so if you flip a coin and decide to walk down to the child node, you wind up back
where you started immediately.
</p>

<p>
13:27:09 @tangentstorm and are presented with the exact same choice again.
13:27:40 @tangentstorm so you just keep looping until either your coin tells you to start a new instance
13:28:08 @tangentstorm or some other worker sets the child pointer to resume a task that they're leaving.
13:28:29 @tangentstorm now for the kicker&#x2026;
13:28:46 sirdancealo3 mm
13:28:50 @tangentstorm this property of being able to randomly choose to go forward or descend the tree&#x2026;
13:29:11 @tangentstorm this same choice works no matter where you are in the tree.
13:29:55 @tangentstorm that is why, when you reach the bottom, you are simply teleported back to the hub.
13:30:06 @tangentstorm well.
13:30:18 @tangentstorm except first you pass "through the looking glass"
13:30:23 @tangentstorm (the mirror node)
13:30:35 @tangentstorm which can randomly teleport you to any workstation (leaf node)
13:30:44 @tangentstorm now there may not be anything to do there.
13:30:50 @tangentstorm wait.
13:30:54 @tangentstorm it's not randomly teleporting you.
13:31:05 @tangentstorm you are randomly deciding whether to keep walking around the ring or not.
13:31:27 @tangentstorm (on the mirror nodes, you have the aditional choice of going back through the
mirror)
13:31:33  * sirdancealo3 blinks
13:31:47 sirdancealo3 you are gonna get rich when quantum computers arrive
13:31:50 sirdancealo3 or ant computers
13:31:50 @tangentstorm :D
13:32:18 sirdancealo3 haha..no, its cool, dude
13:33:00 @tangentstorm so basically all the working memory is stored in little tokens that are sitting
around these nodes.. tokens = documenst, whatever&#x2026; whatever you would need to do
in order to do the job at that workstation.
13:33:29 @tangentstorm since all the data is stored in the tree, the computers can all be very dumb
13:33:38 @tangentstorm and they don't need any ram of their own.
13:33:45 @tangentstorm "ants" is a very good analogy.
13:34:07 sirdancealo3 we should really build an ant computer
13:34:12 @tangentstorm :)
13:35:13 sirdancealo3 i dont follow about the ram thing
13:36:11 sirdancealo3 and this whole thing is an integral part of your big project?
13:36:29 sirdancealo3 its like, a better cpu architecture part?
13:38:49 sirdancealo3 or is this just inside the forth VM&#x2026;
14:05:44 @tangentstorm sorry got called away.
14:06:51 @tangentstorm sirdancealo3: which ram thing? i will try to clarify :)
14:07:23  * sirdancealo3 away now
14:07:28 @tangentstorm but yeah, it's all part of the project.
14:07:31 @tangentstorm ok.. later :)
14:08:47 @tangentstorm should have said they don't need <i>much</i> ram
